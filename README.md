# Drug Bioactivity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting drug bioactivity using machine learning techniques and molecular descriptors extracted from the ChEMBL database.

## Overview

The project includes the following components:
- **Data Extraction and Preprocessing:** Bioactivity data was extracted from the ChEMBL database and preprocessed to prepare it for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical analysis and visualizations were performed to gain insights into the dataset.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Various machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to predict drug bioactivity.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Model performance metrics (R-squared, MSE) were compared to identify the best-performing approach.

## Contents
